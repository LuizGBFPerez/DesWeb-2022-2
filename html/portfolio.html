        <p>Sniping's a good job mate. Challenging work. Outta doors. I <i>guarantee</i> you won't go hungry. Because at the end of the day, as long there's two people left on the planet, someone is going to want someone <b>dead</b>.</p>


        <p>Dad... I'm a... I'm not a crazed gunman dad, I'm an <i>assassin</i>. Well the difference being one's a job and the other's mental sickness!</p>

        <p>I'll be honest with you, my parents, do <b>not</b> care for it.</p>

        <p> I think his mate saw me... <i>Yes, yes he did!</i></p>

        <p>Be <b>polite</b>.</p>

        <p>Be <b>efficient</b>.</p>

        <p>Have a plan to kill <b>everyone</b> you meet.</p>
